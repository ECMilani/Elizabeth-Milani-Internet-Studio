<h1>Assignment 2</h1>
<h2>Conversations with Robots: Voice, Smart Agents, & the Case for Structured Content</h2>
    <h3>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h3>
        <p>A structured content design approach frames content resources—like articles, recipes, product descriptions, how-tos, profiles, etc.—not as pages to be found and read, but as packages composed of small chunks of content data that all relate to one another in meaningful ways.</p>
        <p>Semantic HTML is markup that communicates information about the meaningful relationships between document elements, as opposed to simply describing how they should look on screen.</p>
        <p>Structured content communicates to algorithms, while semantic HTML communicates to people.</p>
    <h3>How do they work together?</h3>
        <p>Structured content allows for ease of research through search engines and popups, while HTML allows for ease of use of an actual website.</p>
    <h3>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</h3>
        <p>Structured content allows retrieval of data by third-party sites, while semantic HTML improves the look and readability of your own site.</p>

<h2>Banishing Your Inner Critic</h2>
    <h3>Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, which would be most successful for you? Why?</h3>
        <p>I feel like giving my inner critic a “time out” would be most effective to me. There are points in my creative process where I genuinely do need to self-critique, but having it around all the time keeps me from getting things done. With temporarily banishing it, and then letting it shine later, I can both get things done and let my inner critic go wild on the things that actually <em>need</em> critique.</p>
<h2>Procrastination</h2>
    <h3>In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you?</h3>
        <p>Hyperbolic discounting means that all the things you don’t want to deal with tend to get pushed off for a hypothetical “future self” to worry about, while all the good things are often prioritized for the present moment. It also leads to over-committing to future plans, because again, it’s all a problem for the “future self”.</p>
        <p>One of the methods outlined in the article is to give the future self less freedom to sabotage what the present self has already planned for. This could be done with something as simple as making plans with a friend for lunch, so the future self doesn’t forget to eat. Having an accountability partner works best for me, because then I am less likely to forget the rest of the world exists if there is someone to remind me.</p>
