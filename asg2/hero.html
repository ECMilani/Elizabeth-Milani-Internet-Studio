<h2>About</h2>
<h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>Rumi is the main character of the animated film <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPop_Demon_Hunters">KPOP Demon Hunters</a></em>. She is the leader of the Kpop group "HUNTR/X" by day, and a demon hunter by night.</p>
<br>
<h3>Personality</h3>
    <p>Rumi is extremely dedicated to her mission, both as a hunter and a pop star. She's been described as someone who doesn't how to take a break. Despite the confident persona she projects outwardly, Rumi is hiding a great deal of shame, and the longer she hides it, the more it eats her up inside.</p>
<br>
<h3>Backstory</h3>
    <p>Rumi's mother was a demon hunter, and a member of a band called "Sunlight Sisters". Rumi's mother entered into a forbidden affair with a demon that resulted in Rumi's birth.</p>
    <p>After Rumi's mother died, Rumi was raised by her mother's bandmate and fellow hunter, Celine, who taught her to always cover up the distinctive patterns that marked her as being part-demon. Celine built HUNTR/X around Rumi, recruiting Rumi's two band-mates, Mira and Zoey, who were both left unaware of Rumi's demonic heritage.</p>
<br>
<h2>Story</h2>
    <p>Via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPop_Demon_Hunters">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
    <p>After completing their world tour, Huntr/x release and prepare for the first live performance of a new single, "Golden", until Rumi begins losing her voice due to her demon patterns spreading.</p>
    <p>While on a trip to see a doctor for Rumi, Huntr/x encounters the Saja Boys, a new boy band, and realizes that the band is actually made up of demons seeking to steal the souls of Huntr/x's fans. The hunters persue Saja, and while fighting, Rumi and Jinu, the demon band's leader, are separated from the others. Jinu discovers Rumi's demon marks as they fight, but helps hide it from her bandmates.</p>
    <p>As the Idol Awards approach, Huntr/x rush to produce a new song, "Takedown", to expose the Saja Boys while their popularity skyrockets. Mira grows suspicious when Rumi questions if "Takedown" is too hateful toward demons. Torn between her identities, Rumi proposes a plan to Jinu: if he helps Huntr/x win the Idol Awards and strengthen the Honmoon, he could freely stay in the human world. Later, Rumi confides in Jinu that her shame over her heritage weakened her voice, but talking with him healed it. Jinu states that he no longer hears voices thanks to Rumi, and agrees to sabotage the Saja Boys.</p>
    <p>At the Idol Awards, the Saja Boys fail to appear, and Huntr/x perform "Golden", having chosen to shelve "Takedown" due to the contention it caused within the group. However, impostor demons sent by Jinu split Mira and Zoey from Rumi, then pose as them to trick Rumi into performing "Takedown", during which they publicly reveal her demon marks. She flees the stage and runs into the real Mira and Zoey, who feel betrayed upon learning of her heritage and collusion with Jinu. Rumi confronts Jinu for tricking her, and he admits to lying about his past.</p>
    <p>While the Saja Boys perform a concert meant to permanently destroy the barrier between the human and demon worlds, Rumi meets with Celine and desperately asks her to end her life. Celine refuses and offers to conceal the events, but Rumi lashes out at Celine for never fully loving her before leaving.</p>
    <p>Rumi interrupts the Saja Boys' performance with a new song addressing shame and self-acceptance. Mira and Zoey join her. Reunited, Huntr/x fight back and defeat the demons.</p>
<br>
<h2>Why She's A Hero</h2>
<h3>Dedication</h3>
    <p>Rumi is dedicated to hunting demons, making and performing music, and to her friends. Her work ethic allows Huntr/x to make the barrier between the human and demon worlds stronger than anyone before them has ever managed.</p>
<br>
<h3>Empathy</h3>
    <p>This is something Rumi learns throughout the plot of <em>KPOP Demon Hunters</em>. She begins the movie with a very black and white view - hunters are all good, demons are all evil, and her own split heritage is the only shameful exception.</p>
    <p>However, as Rumi's relationship with Jinu, a demon, deepens, Rumi begins to feel empathetic towards him once she learns about his background and the struggles he deals with.</p>
    <p>This empathy towards Jinu eventually extends towards other demons. Once she starts to feel for them, it's no longer easy for her to kill them.</p>
    <p>Rumi's ability to feel empathy towards even her sworn enemies shows her kindness, and just how much she cares for others.</p>
<br>
<h3>Making Mistakes & Learning From Them</h4>
    <p>Rumi makes several mistakes throughout the film - hiding her patterns from her friends, Mira and Zoey, being the biggest one.</p>
    <p>As a result of that big mistake, Mira and Zoey lose their trust in Rumi, and Huntr/x briefly breaks up.</p>
    <p>Rumi writes a new song, talking about her regrets in hiding her demonic patterns, and showing that she's willing to truly stop hiding. This demonstration of change allows Huntr/x to get back together.</p>
    <p>No one is perfect. Rumi makes mistakes, but she owns up to them, and does everything she can to fix them.</p>
