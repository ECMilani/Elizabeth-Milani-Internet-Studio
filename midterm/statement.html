	<h2>Typography</h2>
	<p>The header typography is pulled directly from the covers of the books that inspired this website. It's called "We Do Bones", and was <a href="https://noblenico.tumblr.com/post/774951201022279680/this-has-taken-hours-of-work-comparing-different">created by a fan</a> as a love letter towards the design of the original books, and I was happy to be able to use it on my site to continue the aesthetic of the books. The other font I used is called "Ledger", as I chose it because I loved the almost fantastical-gothic design of it, and I thought it complemented the "We Do Bones" font really well.</p>
	<p>The sizing was pulled from the <a href="https://baseline.is/tools/type-scale-generator/">Baseline type scale generator</a> website, where I chose a Major Third ratio for my headers and paragraphs - it felt like just the right contrast between a header that was big, but not big enough to dwarf the paragraphs.</p>
	<h2>Color Palette & Images</h2>
	<p><em>The Locked Tomb</em> series is full of love to gothic culture and aesthetics, with the skeletons, religious imagery, and moody themes that still managed to be filled with so much fun and joy. I wouldn't to have that in the color scheme, with a website that is mostly black and white. The red accents are both because red looks great with a black & white palette, and a nod to the violence in the original books - as mentioned elsewhere on this site, <em>The Locked Tomb</em> is part murder mystery!</p>
	<p>All the images used are created by fans - this story sadly hasn't gained an official adaptation yet, and there is very little official art to work off of. The fandom for <em>The Locked Tomb</em> is one of the things that makes me love engaging with the story so much, so I felt it was fitting to give them part of this website.</p>
	<p>And the skull icons - that is inspiration pulled directly with the design of the book, where skulls are used to accent chapter titles. The specific skull I chose is the insignia of the first house - the planet where Canaan House is based.</p>
	<h2>Buttons</h2>
	<p>I wanted something that looked sleek and professional, reminiscent of real-life travel sites, which is why I chose the rounded buttons. I also chose the make the header buttons black-on-white instead of white-on-black so that they'd stand out from the page.</p>
	<h2>The Notes</h2>
	<p>The notes scattered throughout this website are pulled directly from the pages of <em>Harrow the Ninth</em>, the second book in the <em>Locked Tomb</em> series. These notes are found throughout Canaan House as the titular character, Harrow, realizes that she is the only one who can see what is written on them, because she is being targeted by a particularly vengeful ghost. I wanted to use CSS animations to create a "haunted" effect, with elements that appeared and disappeared, and I thought that hiding these notes throughout the site would be the perfect opportunity for that.</p>
