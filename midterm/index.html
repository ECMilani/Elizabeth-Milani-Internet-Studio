<div id="about">
	<h2>Where</h2>
	<p>Canaan House sits above the crashing waves of the First House, a planet in the Dominicus system. The First House was the original home of the Emperor Undying, and Canaan House is where the first ever Lyctors were created.</p>
	<p>In the Dominicus system are nine planets, referred to as "Houses", each with a different responsibility. The Second House is the center of the Nine Houses' military operations. The third house is where the system's wealth is based. The fourth house is where soldiers go to train. The fifth house are the ghost specialists. The sixth house is home to the great libraries. The seventh house are the medical experts who study the body in life more than in death. The eighth house are the soul specialists. And the ninth house has the most important role of all - protecting the tomb which must never be opened.</p>
	<h2>When</h2>
	<p>The ten-thousandth year of the King Undying, the kindly Prince of Death! (A.K.A. ten thousand years from today. The story exists in a post-post-apocalyptic universe, in which 33% of humans have evolved to have necromantic abilities as a result of humanity being brought back from the dead en masse ten thousand years ago by God, also known as the Emperor.)</p>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>The basement of Canaan House predates the Resurrection, offering untold necromantic secrets. The rest of the structure was built within the following century, in order to achieve both aesthetic appeal and to have more space for research regarding the Lyctoral Process.</p>
	<p><em>"Rearing up before them was a palace, a fortress, of white and shining stone. It spread out on the surface of the water like an island. You couldn't see over it and you could hardly see around it. It lapped back in terraces of what must have once been fabulous gardens. It rose up in gracious towers that hurt the eye with their slenderness and precision. It was a monument to wealth and beauty. Back in its day, at least, it would have been a monument to wealth and beauty."</em></p>
	<p>The purpose of visiting Canaan House is to learn the secrets required to become a Lyctor - which is a sort of uber-powerful necromancer. The current Lyctors are viewed as saintlike figures, thanks to both their connection to God and their incredible power.</p>
	<h2>Beware</h2>
	<p class="beware">There is an evil that lurks within this house, left behind from the indelicle sin committed in the process of creating the first Lyctors. Necromancers, stay weary. Never open a locked door without permission. Never empty out a body of its soul, lest something sinister take over. Never bring in anyone from beyond the house. Keep your cavaliers close at all times.</p>
