	<h2>The Pool Room</h2>
	<p>This room serves as a training facility and sparring court for cavaliers to let their energy out! This room also contains a "chemical pit" currently in the process of being refurbished into a functioning swimming pool, courtesy of the Third House. Enjoy a dip or a spar, or just some socializing with your fellow houses.</p>
	<h2>Lab 2: Transferance / Winnowing</h2>
	<p><em>"It's the theorem from the trial room, [...] It's the complete methodology for transference--for the utilisation of a living soul."</em></p>
	<p>Head down the facility to really put your necromancer-cavalier bond to the test with Lab Two! The necromancer will stand in one sealed chamber, while the cavalier stands in the other - the necromancer will have to borrow the cavalier's eyes to help the cavalier fight the monster in their chamber, as a cavalier alone could never hope to figure out how to defeat the thing. A great way to really get to know your cavalier better - get inside their head, if you will.</p>
	<h2>Solve the Mystery</h2>
	<p>Upon your arrival at Canaan House, you will notice a pattern to those who fall victim to the monster and are ultimately slain. Solve the mystery by deciphering who is behind the pattern, who is a target, and how the bodies died. Who has motive? Who has made enemies? Who wants to discover the secrets of Lyctorhood, and who would rather keep them hidden? Who doesn't love a good murder mystery?</p>

I KISSED YOU AND LATER I WOULD KISS HIM TOO BEFORE I UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU WERE, AND ALL THREE OF US LIVED TO REGRET IT—BUT WHEN I AM IN HEAVEN I WILL REMEMBER YOUR MOUTH, AND WHEN YOU ROAST DOWN IN HELL I THINK YOU WILL REMEMBER MINE">
