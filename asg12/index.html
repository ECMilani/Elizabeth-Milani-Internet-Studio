	<h1>Recommended Movies</h1>
	<p>I chose a movie from each of the twelve main movie genres. Incidentally, most of these movies are rated R, because I love love love violence. And corruption arcs. And unhappy endings. And assassins.</p>

		<h2>The Descent</h2>
		<p><em>The Descent</em> is one of the most terrifying <strong>horror</strong> films I've ever watched. The story follows a group of women who get lost in an unexplored cave.

		<h2>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h2>
		<p><em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em> is a <strong>romance</strong>/breakup movie that asks the question: if you could erase all memories of someone who broke your heart, would you? Not only is it a great, wonderfully psychological movie, it also inspired my favorite song of all time - "Eternal Sunshine" by Flower Face.</p>

		<img src="images/comedy.jpg">
		<h2>Shaun of the Dead</h2>
		<p><em>Shaun of the Dead</em> is zom-com (zombie-<strong>comedy</strong>) about a great of friends attempting to survive the zombie apocalypse by getting wasted at their favorite bar. It's hilarious, and also, was the first R-rated movie I ever watched.</p>
