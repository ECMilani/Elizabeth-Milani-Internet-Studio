	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<h2>Reading</h2>
	<p>From this week's reading material, I learned a lot about the early web:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The early web was more static and less interactive than today's Internet. It was essentially a digital magazine, with pictures and articles that could be read, but without the ability to do things like leave comments or interact with a site beyond viewing it.</li>
		<li>Coders have been using "hacks", such as a single-pixel gif to create space on a page, since practically the invention of html.</li>
		<li>The use of personal sites over social media is making a comeback today, as people are beginning to prefer the privacy and the ability to own their own data.</li>
	</ol>
