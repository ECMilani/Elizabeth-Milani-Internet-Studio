<h1>Least Favorite (Fictional) Person</h1>
<p class="intro">My least favorite (fictional) person is Gentle Criminal from the anime <em>My Hero Academia</em> - not because he's a villain, but because he's really, really, really annoying. And also his character design is super ugly.</p>
<h2>Better Villains</h2>
	<p><em>My Hero Academia</em> is filled with way better villains than this guy, such as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Stain, who also uses the Internet to spread his evil, but is scary instead of annoying.</li>
		<li>Dabi, another villain who uses media to fuel an agenda, but has a better agenda than clout-chasing.</li>
		<li>Toga Himiko, a villain whose story also revolves around romance, but her flirting with her love interests doesn't make me gag.</li>
	</ul>
