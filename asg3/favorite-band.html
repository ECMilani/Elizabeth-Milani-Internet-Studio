	<h2>Why She Is My Favorite</h2>
		<h3>The Lyrics</h3>
			<p>Flower Face's lyrics are beautifully poetic, and just as haunting. The perfect example of her masterful lyricism is her song "Angela", which features lines such as <em>"You walk like a miracle, bathing in starlight / Your voice burning holes in the frame / I danced in the parking lot, cried in the taxi home / 'Cause I still remember your name"</em>. Through these lyrics, Flower Face expertly conveys the feeling of longing and heartbreak.</p>
