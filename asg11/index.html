	<h1>Dodgeball Team</h1>
	<p>As a kid, I was bad at dodgeball. So, I'm assembling a team of characters I think would be even worse at it than I was, so that I can feel better about myself by comparison. Please note that I ADORE these characters, I just think that for one reason or another, they would be really bad at this sport. Since this is a team made to fail, it only feels right to name them the Falling Stars.</p>

<div class="row1">
	<div id="harrow">
		<img src="images/harrow.png">
		<h2>Harrowhark Nonagesimus</h2>
		<p>Harrow Nonagesimus would make a terrible athlete for many reasons. She has the build of a pencil. She struggles with even the lightest of swords. She's incapable of playing nice with others. And it's why she'd be perfect for my team.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="huacheng">
		<img src="images/huacheng.png">
		<h2>Hua Cheng</h2>
		<p>Hua Cheng is a great athlete, actually, but if his boyfriend isn't around, he wouldn't care enough to put any effort into playing. He's <em>also</em> a terrible team player with a love of antagonizing his allies. He'd contribute greatly to the Falling Stars' dysfunction.</p>
	</div>

<div class="row2">
	<div id="marks">
		<img src="images/marks.png">
		<h2>Mark S.</h2>
		<p>Mark is terrible at dodging. Just look at how Helly R, on her very first day of being alive, was able to nail him right in the face with a certain projectile. And while he's far better at working with others than some other names on this list, his tendency towards anger would not fly over well with his teammates.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="overhaul">
		<img src="images/overhaul.png">
		<h2>Overhaul</h2>
		<p>Overhaul doesn't have arms, but if that's not enough for you, he's also a terrible human being. Say what you will about his teammates, but they've all got lines that they won't cross. He can come up with genius strategies, sure, but it won't matter because no one is going to listen to him.</p>
	</div>

<div class="row3">
	<div id="romance">

		<h2>Romance Saja</h2>
		<p>Is he a hundred-year-old demon? Yes. Do I think he'd be terrible at dodgeball? Uncertain... but I do think he'd get distracted by flirting with the spectators, completely ignoring his team.</p>
